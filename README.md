# WAR-card game

 The deck is divided evenly, with each player receiving 26 cards, dealt one at a time,
 face down. Anyone may deal first. Each player places his stack of cards face down,
 in front of him.
 
 If the cards are the same rank, it is War. Each player turns up three cards face
 down and one card face up. The player with the higher cards takes both piles
 (six cards). If the turned-up cards are again the same rank, each player places
 another card face down and turns another card face up. The player with the
 higher card takes all 10 cards, and so on.
